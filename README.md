# 👀 Observer Pattern Example — CE-2103

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains a simple implementation of the **Observer Design Pattern** developed for the course CE2103 — Algoritmos y Estructuras de Datos II at Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica.

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object (the subject) changes state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically.

## 🧩 Key Concepts

- **Subject (Observable)**: Maintains a list of observers and notifies them of any changes.
- **Observers**: Receive updates whenever the subject’s state changes.
- Demonstrates **decoupling** between subject and observers.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: C++
- **Build System**: CMake
- **Structure**: Single-file proof of concept (`main.cpp`)
